# Variables

A variable is a way to store data, you give a *identifier* a *value* and you can later access it, below is how you create a variable in SpecScript.

```js
variable1="hello" // define the variable
log(variable1) // log the variable
```

You can use variables to store any data type, and you can later access it.
