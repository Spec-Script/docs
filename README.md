# Docs for SpecScript

This is the offical documentation for *SpecScript*. The language is still in a early development stage, so if you find any bugs, please open a issue. There will be documentation updates everytime there are changes.

- [Variables](https://github.com/Spec-Script/docs/blob/main/docs/variables.md)

- [Methods (Functions)](https://github.com/Spec-Script/docs/blob/main/docs/methods.md)

Remeber, valid JavaScript code is valid SpecScript code, unless it has been modified for SpecScript, for example,

```js
const hello = "hello"
/*
  That is not valid, since you dont defince variables like that in SpecScript
*/

// You define variables in a python way,
hello = "hello" // correct way
```
